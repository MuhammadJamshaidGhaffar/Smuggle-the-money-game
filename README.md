Two countries have invested 1 lac in other country . Now two countries are at the verge of war . War can broke out at any moment. So, before war breaks both countries are trying their best to smuggle their invested money from opposite country. They will send their agents turn by turn.

Turn 1 :
       
       Agent from left country comes into the right country through crossing the border. 
       After passsing through the border gate, gate will be closed and will not open . 
       Agent has to find the money bag in a limited time.
       
       If agent fails to find the money bag oppsoite country will capture the agent
       and will trade the agent with a large amount of money. So, ultimately opposite country wins.
       
	If agent finds the money bag, agent will enter the money he wants to smuggle. 
	Agent can't carry more than 50 lacs in one turn. After entering the money agent
	will go into the inspection room because he  cannot go back from the border .
	Now inspector from oppsite country comes to inspect the agent. 
	Inspector will decide to inspect the agent or let the agent pass(no inspection)
	
	If inspector press the pass button then no inspection will be done and money
	will be smuggled by the agent.
	But if inspector presses the inspect button then inspector has to predict how much money agent
	is gambling. If inspector's guess is within +- 10k range then inspector will
	get all the smuggled money. 
	But if inspector guesses the wrong then agent will get all the smuggled money + half of the money
	guessed by the inspector and inspector will lose half of the guessed money


After 6 turns which country smuggled more will win
